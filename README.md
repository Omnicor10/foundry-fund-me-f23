## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

## Usage
This is a funding contract that keeps track the funders (by their wallet address) and how much they have contributed. This contract only allows deposits of over $5, if under $5 an error message will pop up "You need to spend more ETH!". Only the owner of the contract can can withdraw from the contract and once it has been withdrawn the list of funders are reset.
